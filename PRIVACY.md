### Android Device Identifier (Android ID)

The Software accesses the Android system-provided **Android ID**.
This identifier is used strictly for the following purposes:

* Preventing abuse of the translation service (e.g., automated requests, bots, or excessive usage)
* Enforcing service limits and maintaining fair usage
* Detecting fraudulent or malicious behavior
* Maintaining service stability and quality
* Providing consistent service functionality on the same device

### Important Clarifications

The Android ID:

* **is NOT used for advertising**
* **is NOT used for user profiling**
* **is NOT used to track your activity across apps or websites**
* **is NOT shared with advertisers or data brokers**
* **does NOT allow us to determine your real-world identity**

We use the identifier only as a technical mechanism to distinguish devices interacting with our service backend. It is treated as a **security and service integrity measure**, not as personal identification.
